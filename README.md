# Research questions

here are some of the questions to be answered with this experiments

### Anatoley-Gerko as a regularized loss function

In the unnormalized anatoley-gerko loss `L = C * B - A` is the B term a form of regularization?

what happens when `C >> 1` and when `C << 1`

### Loss comparison

How does AG-loss compare with cross-entropy and weighted cross-entropy

# Concepts

### Order

Order `o = (e, p, v, t)`

e = Direction = {+1 for buy and -1 for sell}
p = price (it is discrete)
v = volume (number of assets)
t = time

L_r = L + R()
